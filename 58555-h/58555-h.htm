<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>TO THE
PUBLIC.</h2>
<p>THE following statements will fully explain the motives which
induced the Editor to expose the crimes of the individual who is
the subject of them.&nbsp; The demand for those numbers of the
WEEKLY DISPATCH in which they appeared, was so great, that many
hundreds of persons were unable to procure the papers, as no more
could be printed than those which were called for on the days of
publication.&nbsp; The Editor, therefore, wishing to extend his
efforts in defence of religion and morality as widely as
possible, by holding up to all mankind a true picture of a
blasphemous hypocrite who is a contemner of the one and a
violator of the other, has thought it advisable to publish the
whole of his narratives and remarks in a separate pamphlet; to
which are subjoined many additional facts that could not appear
in a Sunday Paper.&nbsp; The reason this publication has been so
long delayed was, in expectation that <span class="smcap">John
Church</span> would have been brought to trial in the beginning
of June, <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>for
an abominable offence with which he stands charged and committed,
but as there is some reason to suspect that this trial will be
put off even at the ensuing Sessions for the County of Middlesex,
the public curiosity cannot be kept any longer unsatisfied.</p>

CHURCH,<br />
<span class="GutSmall"><i>THE OBELISK PREACHER</i></span>.</h2>
<h3><i>Extract from the Weekly Dispatch of April</i> 18.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the various duties of a
newspaper editor, one of the most arduous is, that of determining
what sort of domestic events it may be useful to cover over with
a veil of silence, and what sort are they, of which the
concealment would operate as an injury to the public.&nbsp;
Occurrences will often take place in private life, which, on
every principle of moral expediency and justice, ought never to
be born beyond the threshold of the place where the parties
reside.&nbsp; And, on the other hand, there are certain acts,
which, if passed over without notice by civil authority, or
animadversion on the part of the press, may produce evils
destructive to society.&nbsp; Another laborious task imposed on a
journalist is the dilemma in which his duty to the public and his
fear of offending the delicacy of individuals, frequently places
him, when he is about to record events which cannot be suppressed
without doing a serious injury to public morals. <a
name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a>&nbsp; I am well aware that things <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>must not be
related in all that naked grossness of truth, which a legal
tribunal requires for promoting the ends of justice; and that as
much delicacy as is consistent with correctness of information,
is necessary in narrations of the sort to which I allude.&nbsp;
This has been the principle on which I have uniformly acted in
the conduct of this paper.&nbsp; But to suppress in a newspaper
the publication of a fact which meets the eyes and ears of all
people would be at once absurd and mischievous.&nbsp; For
instance, in the month of October, 1810, 6 or 7 miscreants were
placed in the pillory in the presence of many thousand
spectators; they were then conveyed through the most public
streets in an open cart, during which time they were pelted with
mud and dirt by an indignant populace: all the inhabitants of the
streets viewed this disgusting exhibition from their windows; and
could it have been possible&mdash;nay, must it not have been
mischievous to conceal from any body the crime for which these
culprits were then punished?&nbsp; How foolish then would it have
been for any reader of a newspaper to be offended at seeing it
mentioned in print?</p>
<p>I have thought it necessary to preface with these remarks, the
narrative of facts which I am now about to relate; and which I
should at present abstain from noticing were it possible to give
them publicity through the medium of any court of justice.&nbsp;
But as two eminent counsellors <a name="citation6"></a><a
href="#footnote6" class="citation">[6]</a> have given an opinion
against the <i>legal practicability</i> of such a procedure, for
reasons which I shall presently state; and as in the mean time
the public morals may suffer;&mdash;the press must on this
occasion interpose as their guardian.</p>
<p>The readers will recollect having seen in last Sunday&rsquo;s
Dispatch, a report of the proceedings before the magistrates at
Union Hall, when a conventicle preacher of the name of Church
complained of a riotous mob having assembly near the entrance of
his Chapel at the Obelisk in St. George&rsquo;s fields, and
attempted to commit violence upon him and his congregation.&nbsp;
That report was copied from a <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>daily paper, and was very imperfectly
stated.&nbsp; I have since then, made a full enquiry into all the
circumstances of this case; and I shall now briefly state them
from <i>authentic documents</i>, <i>that are ready to be produced
if necessary</i>.&nbsp; For a considerable time past, the person
just named has been getting a living by preaching as a Minister
of the Gospel in an obscure conventicle close to the Surrey
Theatre.&nbsp; In the mean time, reports had gone abroad that he
was addicted to certain abominable propensities, and certain
gentlemen in the neighbourhood, not actuated by any jealousy
towards a successful &ldquo;rival in the vineyard,&rdquo; as the
Union-hall report falsely stated, but dreading the disgrace and
pollution which Christianity might suffer from the immoral
character of any of its teachers, investigated these rumours; and
the facts I shall now relate came to light.&nbsp; James Cook, who
kept the infamous house in Vere Street, was released from his two
years imprisonment in Newgate, on the 21st of September
last.&nbsp; In the course of a few days after, I understand, he
accidentally met John Church, and recognized him as the <i>gay
parson</i>, whom he had formerly seen at a certain house in the
London Road, and at his own house in Vere Street.&nbsp; A
friendly correspondence then took place between these two old
acquaintances.&nbsp; About the 13th of October, Cook received a
letter, of which a fac simile has been published in St.
George&rsquo;s fields, <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a> and of which I have
seen the original in Church&rsquo;s <i>own handwriting</i>,
(having compared it with other writings of his).&nbsp; In this
the <i>Minister of the Gospel</i> offers his assistance to the
&ldquo;Vere Street Culprit,&rdquo; to enable him to set up
another public house, as the reader will perceive from perusing
the letter itself:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Lest I should not have time to call on you or converse with
you as I shall not be alone to Day I thought it But Right to Drop
you a Line I wish you all the success you can desire in <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>getting a house
fit for the Business in the public Line and as you had a great
many acquaintance, they ought not to fail you if evey one acted
right according to there ability I am sure you would soon
accomplish it.&nbsp; As I am By no means Rich, But rather em
barrassed I hope you will acept my mite towards it 1l. 1s. and
you shall have another as convenient wishing all prosperity,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I Remain Your&rsquo;s, sincerely,<br
/>
J. <span class="smcap">Church</span>.</p>
<p>for Mr. Cook, at mr. halladays Richmond Budgs Dean St.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is another letter bearing the two-penny post mark of the
20th of October, which I have also seen.&mdash;It is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I received your note this morning in Bed, as I have contracted
such a Dreadful cold Being wet on tuesday I am very much grievd i
have not been able to comply with the request concerning Mr.
C&mdash;&nbsp; But I shall certainly keep my eye upon him and Do
him all the Good it lays in my power where ever he is he knows my
Disposition too well to impute any remissness to my conduct But I
cannot Do impossibilities as I have Lately had and have now Got
so many Distressing cases in hand Beside, I will Be sure to call
on you as soon as I can&mdash; But am not able to day</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I remain Yours J CHURCH</p>
<p>32 hercules Buildings</p>
<p>Badly directed to Mr. Oliver, or (Holloway) No. 6,
Richmond&rsquo;s buildings, Dean Street, Soho.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next document is a letter dated March 7, 1810, from a
person at Banbury named Hall, who says that there was a report
there against Church of a very scandalous nature.&nbsp; And that
the managers of the chapel, after making enquiries into it, sent
him positive orders never to return to Banbury again.</p>
<p>Then follows a letter from Wm. Clarke of Ipswich, a <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>young man
between 19 and 20 years of age, which contains an account of
attempts too horrid to be published in this paper.&nbsp; I have
within the last four days seen the written confession (frightful
indeed it is) of this poor simple young man, whose mind was
bewildered by the canting exhortations of Church; and I have
heard the whole of his statements corroborated by the oral
testimony of a Mr. Wire who resides at Colchester, and knows
Clarke very well.&nbsp; The circumstances related by Clarke,
would have furnished an ample ground for a criminal prosecution
had he made his complaint <i>immediately</i> after the
<i>assault</i> was committed:&mdash;but suffering under the
influence of ignorance and fear, he kept it a secret too long,
and afterwards accepted of a pound note from Church.&nbsp; A case
was laid before two eminent barristers, to have their opinion
whether such a prosecution could be carried on with any prospect
of conviction.&nbsp; Their opinion, which I now have before me in
their own hand writing, is, that after the long concealment of a
Charge, a Jury would pay no attention to his evidence, unless he
was confirmed in his story by other evidence.</p>
<p>The peace of this poor lad&rsquo;s mind however is completely
destroyed, so fatally has the event preyed upon him:&mdash;so far
so as to fill the bosom of his aged father with such a spirit of
indignation and revenge, that he actually came up to London with
a full determination to be the death of him who had thus ruined
the peace of his beloved son, while the mother&rsquo;s mind was
not less distracted than that of the father.&nbsp; In consequence
of this, the father entered J. Church&rsquo;s meeting house, with
two loaded pistols, one in each pocket, but under the excess of
agitation, he fainted away, and was carried out of the place.</p>
<p>There are various other documents which are too voluminous to
notice at present.&nbsp; The point to which I now wish to direct
the attention of the public is, the extraordinary circumstance of
a man continuing to exercise the functions of a christian pastor
with such heavy imputations as these hanging over his head.&nbsp;
He knows that the whole neighbourhood rings with accusations; he
knows that some hundreds of publications containing charges so <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>severe, that
my statements compared to then, are &ldquo;lenity and
compassion,&rdquo; have been sold in St. George&rsquo;s-fields;
and why has he not brought his action against the printer in
order to let the world see that they are false.</p>
<p>The printer is a respectable and <i>responsible</i>
house-holder residing in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; He has sent
forth from his press many hundred sheets of paper filled with
direct allegations of criminality against Church: and I again
ask, why does not Church take that step which an honest
<i>innocent</i> man would take in vindication of his character,
namely&mdash;that of bringing an action for damages, wherein
evidence to their truth or falsehood may be <i>legally</i>
admitted?&nbsp; Why has he gone to Union Hall with a counsel at
his elbow, and called on the magistrates to do no more than
require the printer to <i>suppress</i> the publication of these
printed papers, which request the magistrates have complied with,
on the ground that such publications tended to a breach of the
peace?&nbsp; I hope that no person&mdash;and I am confident that
no reader of the Weekly Dispatch will be so foolish as to join in
any riotous proceedings.&nbsp; But is Christianity, in the mean
time, to continue suffering under such a slander as that of being
promulgated by a man who is even <i>suspected</i>?&nbsp; A
Clergyman of the Church of England, under similar circumstances,
would be immediately suspended by the Bishop of his
diocese.&nbsp; And is there no power in the state that can impose
a temporary silence on a dissenting minister, until an
investigation shall take place respecting accusation publicly
exhibited against him?&nbsp; Is not the ruling power of the state
as interested in preserving the morals of dissenters as of any
other class of subjects?</p>
<p>The reader may probably have some curiosity to know what sort
of a preacher this person is.&nbsp; I have gone to hear him; and
I pity his poor deluded followers.&nbsp; He does indeed deliver
himself in a full, clear, articulate tone of voice; but to
criticise style, or analyse the <i>substance</i> of his
discourse, would be a fruitless labour: it would be like
dissecting a cobweb.&nbsp; Unmeaning rhapsodies, and unconnected
sentences, through which the faintest gleam of morality is not to
be traced, must, from their evanescent <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>nature, set the powers of
recollection at defiance: they even escape from the lash of
one&rsquo;s contempt. <a name="citation11"></a><a
href="#footnote11" class="citation">[11]</a>&nbsp; In his <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>countenance
there is none of that dignified mildness, none of that subdued
expression of piety which one often observes in Christian
preachers whose habits of life are conformable to their
precepts.&nbsp; His manner is forward and imposing; and his eyes
are continually employed in staring at some person among his
auditors.&nbsp; But these being people of the very lowest
description, and, to all appearance, wrapt in a cloud of
superstitious stupor, scarcely ever examine the physiognomy of
their idol.</p>
<p>I have a word or two, to add on the subject of riotous
proceedings.&nbsp; On Sunday evening last there was a large crowd
of people assembled near the entrance of the Obelisk
Chapel.&nbsp; There were several groupes of persons holding
arguments on the merits of the preacher, but not the slightest
indication of riot.&nbsp; And the only noise or disturbance that
I observed, was created by a gang of fellows who rushed through
the crowd in the character of peace officers with drawn cutlasses
in their hands.</p>
<h3><i>Extract from the Weekly Dispatch of April</i> 25,
1813.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the late Lord Chief Justice
Mansfield promulgated his doctrine &ldquo;<i>that truth was a
libel</i>,&rdquo; he went upon this principle,&mdash;that no man
could be justified in publishing any thing respecting the
character or conduct of another, which should appear, whether
true or false, to be of so <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>abusive and defamatory a nature as to
provoke him to commit a breach of the peace;&mdash;that if the
person so defamed had committed any offence against the law, he
should be dealt with according to law; and that no unauthorized
individual had a right to become his judge.&nbsp; But Lord
Mansfield little thought at that time, that about thirty or forty
years afterwards, a case would occur, wherein, although the
&ldquo;offence was rank and smelt to heaven,&rdquo; the arm of
the law was powerless; and wherein an appeal to public opinion
became indispensible towards arresting the havoc which the most
destructive of all vices that can exist in society was making
upon the public morals.&nbsp; We have now before us a case
precisely of this nature.&nbsp; Here is a man of the most
infamous character&mdash;a man notoriously addicted to the most
horrible of all vices&mdash;a man who has been in the constant
habit of corrupting youth, by the instrumentality and under the
mask of religion&mdash;this man is exercising all the functions
of a Christian minister of the Gospel&mdash;such as reading
prayers, preaching sermons, baptizing, and administering the holy
sacrament;&mdash;a man at the very idea of whose guilt, every
body, except his deluded or <i>sympathetic</i> auditors, shrinks
back with feelings of disgust and agony;&mdash;and yet there
exists no power either ecclesiastical or civil to arrest his
career of blasphemy and guilt!&nbsp; Under such afflicting
circumstances, is the press to continue silent, because the law
tells me that I am not to speak reproachfully of another,
although I should speak the truth?&nbsp; If I see my
neighbour&rsquo;s house on fire, am I to look on with
cold-blooded indifference, without trying to save the whole
street from being involved in flames, because a law may have
declared it a crime for any man to stir, until the beat of a drum
or the ringing of a bell shall have called the people
together?&nbsp; If I see that sort of moral contagion that has
been the ruin of Empires, spreading around me while all the
engines that were intended for its suppression, remain
motionless, am I to refrain from raising my feeble voice against
it, because I run a risk of offending against the <i>letter</i>
of the law?&nbsp; The law in this case is, in some manner at a
stand, as will appear from the report I give of the recent
proceedings <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>before the Surry magistrates.&nbsp; It is supposed be
unable to act here, because it was not called into action when
the crime, that has been sworn to, was perpetrated.&nbsp; Yet the
enormity of the crime not only remains undiminished and unatoned
for, but the criminal is going forward in the same career, and is
in possession of the same influence, that gave scope to his
criminality: and what is still worse, the Christian religion is
suffering under disgrace and pollution!&nbsp; In such a case
then, the press is the only power that can act: and is that power
to be suspended by cold calculating timidity?&nbsp; The chief
duty of a Journalist is to check the progress of any public evil,
by giving activity and force to the <span class="GutSmall">LAW OF
OPINION</span>, when the municipal law cannot reach the
same.&nbsp; This duty I am now exercising; and I do it without
fear, because I feel conscious that I am serving the public; and
because I may be instrumental in saving a large portion of the
rising generation from ignominy and ruin.</p>
<p>That the public feel an uncommon share of interest in this
question is evident, from the great increase of sale which this
paper experienced on Sunday last; and their continued demand for
it ever since.&nbsp; I therefore conceive that my readers would
not be satisfied without some more information respecting the
person to whom I allude; and I now present then, with the chief
incidents of his life, as well as some additional traits of his
character, most of which have come to my knowledge since last
Sunday.&nbsp; The sketch of his life has been furnished me by a
respectable Gentleman on whose veracity I can rely.&nbsp; It is
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Dr. Jortin, in his <i>Adversaria</i>, very justly
remarks, that &ldquo;a sudden rise from a low station, as it
sometimes shews to advantage the virtuous and amiable qualities,
which could not exert themselves before, so it more frequently
calls forth and exposes to view, those spots of the soul which
lay lurking in secret, cramped by penury, and veiled with
dissimulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Obelisk Parson, John Church, was found, when an infant, on
the steps, or near the porch, of a church, (some say that of St.
Andrew, in Holborn): and the overseers <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>of the parish not being able to
discover who were his parents, or by whom he was thus abandoned,
had him sent to the Foundling Hospital, where he received that
name, which bears the nearest analogy to the place near which he
was found.&nbsp; Here he remained until he was nine years old,
when a complaint to the Governors having been made against him by
the nurses, that he was addicted to improper and disgusting
practices, it was thought prudent to apprentice him out at that
early age, to obviate the possibility of the contagion spreading
among the rest of the boys who partook of the bounties of that
charity.&nbsp; From his evident illiteracy, and from the badness
of his writing, it is certain that he must have quitted the
Hospital at an earlier age than usual, because, in general, none
leave it who are not good scholars.&nbsp; He was accordingly
placed out as an apprentice to a gilder, in Black friars&rsquo;
Road.&nbsp; Before the expiration of his indenture, he was
married to his present wife, and he quitted the service of his
master.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards, he worked for a composition
ornament maker, in Tottenham Court Road.&nbsp; This immaculate
Minister of the Gospel here commenced his religious career, and,
under the assumed garb of sanctity, took upon him the office of a
teacher to the Sunday School, at that time established at
Tottenham-Court Chapel.&nbsp; It was here too, that he first
became acquainted with Mr. William Webster, who has been under
the necessity of holding him to bail, to appear at the next
Middlesex Sessions, where an indictment will be preferred against
him for attempts too shocking to be related in print.&nbsp;
Thinking that preaching was a better trade than that which he was
employed in, this <i>precious</i> teacher, together with two
other young men, who were candidates for the gown also, hired a
garret in Soho, where they used to learn the method of addressing
themselves to a congregation.&nbsp; An old chair was the
substitute for a pulpit.&nbsp; He now began (to use his own
expression,) &ldquo;<i>to gammon the old
women</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;Good fortune happened at length to
procure him the notice of Old Mother Barr, of Orange-street, who,
being interested in his behalf, allowed him the use of a room of
her&rsquo;s, in which he treated her and a few other choice
labourers in the field <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>of piety, with his rapturous
discourses.&nbsp; From this he used to hold forth more
publicly.&nbsp; His virtues and acquirements now recommended him
to one Garrett of notorious memory, who obtained him a
<i>living</i> at Banbury.&nbsp; It was at this place that he
first became obnoxious.&nbsp; Having made several violent
attempts upon some young men while at that place, he was driven
out from thence, by the trustees of the chapel, in which he
preached, and ordered never to shew his face there again.&nbsp;
He hastily decamped, leaving behind him his wife and children,
and the police officers having been sent in pursuit of him, their
searches proved fruitless, and it was a long time before he was
heard of.&nbsp; He once more retired into the country, but was
called from his solitude to use his influence in town, by a man
of his own disgraceful kind named <i>Kitty Cambric</i>, and well
known in Vere-street.&nbsp; It is proper to observe here, that
some of these wretches assume the names of women, and that they
are absolutely married together, as will be shewn presently from
Church&rsquo;s having been the parson who performed the
blasphemous mock ceremony of joining them in the ties of
&ldquo;<i>Holy Matrimony</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He now settled himself
at Chapel Court in the Borough, when his old Garrett publicly
charged him with a wicked and diabolical offence as the law says,
&ldquo;not to be named amongst Christians,&rdquo; and he was
obliged to run away from this accusation.&nbsp; By some
fortuitous event he at length got possession of the Obelisk
Chapel, where he began to deliver his doctrines to those who were
foolish and ignorant enough to attend to his fulsome and
incoherent exclamations.&nbsp; Several young men, whose names we
are in possession of, and who were accustomed to hear him, were
obliged to leave him in consequence of his having used them in a
manner too indecent to be mentioned or hinted at.&nbsp; Mr.
E&mdash; B&mdash; has informed the writer of the present article,
that this parson&mdash;or rather this monster&mdash;when he was
about to preach, would frequently say,&mdash;&ldquo;Well, I am
going to tip &rsquo;em a gammoning story, my old women would
believe the moon to be made of green cheese, if I was to tell
them so; and I must tell them something.&rdquo;&mdash;The writer
has also been informed, from credible authority, <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>that Church
was a constant attendant in Vere-street, and that the gang of
miscreants who met at the public-house there, some of whom stood
in the pillory about two years and a half since, had nominated
him to be their <i>Chaplain</i>; and that he officiated in that
capacity.&nbsp; By virtue of his functions, in this situation he
was often employed in joining these monsters in the
&ldquo;indissoluble tie of matrimony!!!&rdquo;&nbsp; They were
absolutely wedded together.&nbsp; One evening, when Church
visited this infamous place of resort, one of the gang observed,
&ldquo;Here is Parson Church.&nbsp; Aye, Parson, how d&rsquo;ye
do?&nbsp; Have you come to see our chapel?&rdquo;&mdash;Church
replied, &ldquo;Yes, and to preach too.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the above account, I have next to mention some
circumstances that have been communicated to me by Mr. E&mdash;
B&mdash;, who is a respectable young man, and a tradesman,
residing in the Borough of Southwark.&nbsp; Mr. B&mdash;
happened, unfortunately, to be an attendant at Church&rsquo;s
meeting house, when the latter took notice of and formed an
acquaintance with him, commencing as usual with pious
exhortations, and then followed up by disgusting freedoms.&nbsp;
Mr. B&mdash;, however, struck with horror at such conduct,
abandoned the place, and then he received two letters from
Church, of which the following are copies.&nbsp; Had this wretch
received a classical education, one might suppose he had been
writing a paraphrase on Virgil&rsquo;s eclogue, beginning with
the line&mdash;<i>Formosum</i> Pastor Corydon <i>Ardebat
Alexin</i>.</p>
<p>The thoughts, however, originated in his own polluted
mind.&nbsp; The letters will serve to gratify curiosity, and give
a further illustration of his stile and character.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Ned,</p>
<p>May the best of blessings be yours in life and in death, <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>while the
sweet sensations of real genuine disinterested friendship rules
every power of your mind body and soul I can only say I wish you
was as much captivated with sincere friendship as I am but we all
know our own feelings best&nbsp; Friendship those best of names,
affection those sweetest power like some powerful charm that
overcomes the mind&mdash;I could write much on this subject but I
dare not trust you with what I could say much as I esteem
you&mdash;You would consider it as unmanly and quite effeminate,
and having already proved what human nature is I must conceal
even those emotions of love which I feel I wish I had the honor
of being loved by you as much and in as great a degree as I do
you.&nbsp; Sometimes the painful thought of a separation
overpowers me, many are now trying at it but last night I told
persons that called on me that let them insinuate what they would
I would never sacrifice my dear Ned to the shrine of any other
friend upon earth&mdash;and that them who did not like him should
have none of my company at all&nbsp; I find dear Ned many are
using all their power to part us but I hope it will prove in vain
on your side, the effect that all this has upon me is to make me
love you ten times more than ever, I wish opposition may have the
same effect upon you in this particular but I fear not, however I
am confident if you love me now or at any other time my heart
will ever be upon you nor can I ever forget you till death.&nbsp;
Your leaving of me will break my heart, bring down my poor mind
with sorrow to the Grave and wring from my eyes the briny tears,
while my busy meddling memory will call to remembrance the few
pleasant hours we spent together.&nbsp; I picture to my
imagination the affecting scene the painful thought, I must close
the affecting subject &rsquo;tis more than my feelings are able
to bear&mdash;My hearths full, my mind is sunk, I shall be better
when I have vented out my grief, Stand fast my dearest Ned to me
I shall to you whether you do to me or no, and may we be
pardoned, justified, and brought more to the knowledge of
Christ.&nbsp; O help me to sing&mdash;</p>
<p>When thou my righteous Judge shall come<br />
To fetch thy ransom&rsquo;d people home,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May I among them stand,<br />
Let such a worthless worm as I,<br />
That sometimes am afraid to die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be found at thy right hand.</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>I love
to meet amongst them now,<br />
Before thy gracious feet to bow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tho&rsquo; vilest of them all;<br />
But can I bear the piercing thought,<br />
What if my name should be left out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When thou for them should call.</p>
<p>Learn these two verses by heart and then I will write two
more, as they are expressions of mind fears sensations and
desires&mdash;I must close, I long to see your dear face again, I
long for Sunday morning till then God bless you.</p>

<p>This letter, without a date, was written by the Rev. J.
Church, Minister of Obelisk Chapel, Blackfriar&rsquo;s-road, to
Mr. E&mdash; B&mdash;, at 3, Rodney-street, Lenox-Street,
Borough; and received by him on or about the 15th day March,
1809:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Is this thy kindness to thy once professed much loved friend,
surely I never, never did deserve such cruel treatment at you
hands; why not speak to me last night in James-street when you
heard me call, Stop! stop! Ned! do, pray do; but cruel, cruel
Ned, deaf to all intreaties&mdash;O why was I permitted to pass
the door of Mr. Gibbons when you and West were coming out.&nbsp;
Why was I permuted to tramp up and down the New Cut after you; I
only wanted to speak one bitter heart breaking painful
distressing word, farewell; I only wanted to pour my sorrows into
your bosom, to shake hands with you once more, but I was denied
this indulgence.&nbsp; I never, never thought you would deceive
me&mdash;O what an unhappy man am I; the thing that I most feared
is come upon me, no excuse can justify such apparent duplicity; O
my distress is great indeed.&nbsp; O my God! what shall I
do?&nbsp; O Christ!&nbsp; O God! support me in this trying hour,
what a night am I passing through, I cannot sleep, tis near three
o&rsquo;clock; alas! sleep is departed, how great my grief, how
<a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>bitter my
sorrows, the loss of my character <a name="citation20"></a><a
href="#footnote20" class="citation">[20]</a> is nothing to the
loss of one dearer to me than my thing else.&nbsp; O let me give
vent to tears, but I am too, too much distressed to cry, O that I
could.&nbsp; I feel this like a dagger; never, never can I
forgive the unhappy instrument of my distress in
Charlotte-street.&nbsp; Why did my dear friend Edward deceive
me?&nbsp; O how my mind was eased on Wednesday night; alas, how
distressed on Thursday.&nbsp; I have lost my only bosom friend,
nearest dearest friend, bosom from bosom torn, how horrid.&nbsp;
Ah, dear Suffolk-court, never surely can I see you again.&nbsp;
How the Philistines will triumph; there, so would we have it; how
Ebeir, Calvin, Thompson, Edwards, Bridgman, all will rejoice, and
I have lost my friend, my all in this world, except the other
part of myself, my wife and poor babes; never did I expect this
from my dear E&mdash; B&mdash;.&nbsp; O for a calm mind, that I
might sleep till day light; but no, this I fear will be denied
me.&nbsp; How can I bear the piercing thought, parted; a dreadful
word, worst of sensations, the only indulgence, the only
confident, the only faithful, the only kind and indulgent
sympathising friend, to lose you.&nbsp; O what a stroke, O what a
cut, what shall I do for matter for Sunday; O that I could get
some one to preach for me; how can I lift up my head.&nbsp; O
Sir, if you have a grain of affection left for me, do, do intreat
of God to support me; this is a worse affliction than the loss of
my character nine months ago.&nbsp; A man cannot lose his
character twice.&nbsp; O I did think you knew better; I did think
I had found one in you that I could not find elsewhere; but no,
the first object presented to you seen suddenly gained your mind,
gained your affections; and I, poor unhappy distressed I, am left
to deplore your loss.&nbsp; O for submission, but I am
distressed; woe is me.&nbsp; O that I had never, never known you,
then I should never feel what I do; but I thank you for your
company hitherto, I have enjoyed it four months exactly, but this
is over for ever; miserable as I am, I wish you well for ever,
for ever.&nbsp; I write in the bitterness of my soul which I
feel.&nbsp; May you never be cursed with the feelings I possess
as long as you live.&nbsp; What a day I have before me; I cannot
go out of my house till Sunday morning.&nbsp; How can I conceal
my grief from my dear wife? how shall I hide it? what shall I
say?&nbsp; I am miserable, nor can I surmount <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>the shock at
all.&nbsp; I have no friend to pour out my sorrows to now, I wish
I had; I am sorry you are so easily duped by any to answer their
purposes; my paper is full, my heart is worse; God help me; Lord
God Support me! what shall I do, dear God!&nbsp; O Lord! have
mercy on me, I must close; this comes from your ever loving, but
distressed</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Another Fact</span>.&mdash;It appears from
the testimony of George Turner, and James Russell, of
Redcross-street, of Richard Jessop, of Cattle-street, and William
Williams of the Mint; that the <i>Revd. John Church</i>, on the
16th of November, 1809, attended at the funeral of Richard
Oakden, a clerk in the Bank, who was executed before Newgate on
the 15th for a certain horrible crime.&nbsp; The hearse and coach
set out from the Hat and Feathers public-house, kept by a Mr.
Richardson in Gravel-lane, to which place Church and his company
returned to partake of a jovial dinner.&nbsp; In the course of
the evening the latter behaved with great indecency.</p>
<p>The following bad character has also been given of Church, by
Mr. George Gee and his wife, who keep a cake shop in the New
Cut.&nbsp; I have heard them both declare it to be true:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Church the Minister lodged at our house
a year and a half, and left last year at Lady-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were in hopes that we were about to have a godly
praying minister in our house, and to be sure, the first night he
had somewhat like prayer, <a name="citation21"></a><a
href="#footnote21" class="citation">[21]</a> and that and once
afterwards, <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>were the only times he ever went to family prayer in our
house.&nbsp; Nor could they have any prayer as he would be
frequently out almost all hours of the night, and would lie in
bed till ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; Several times he
and his wife would have skirmishings and fightings between
themselves, while their children would be left to run about the
streets out of school hours, and allowed to keep company with
children, that would swear in our hearing most shockingly.&nbsp;
His children were always left to be very dirty, and would be sent
sometimes three or four times in the morning for spirituous
liquors of all sorts, as for reading good books or even the
Bible, he scarce ever thought of it, but would spend a deal of
his time in loose and vain talk, in walking about, and in fawning
on young men, that was his chief delight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sundays and working days were all alike to them, for
they would send out to buy liquors and whatever else they wanted,
on Sundays as well as other days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house would be frequently more like a play-house,
(I might say a bawdy house) than a minister&rsquo;s house, where
a set of young people would come, and behave more indecently than
ought to be mentioned.&nbsp; Even one Sunday morning they made
such an uproar, as that they broke one of the windows, and after
that, they would go with him to his Chapel, and after that he
would give the sacrament to such disorderly people, let their
characters be ever so loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was always ready to go fast enough out to dinner or
supper, where he could get good eating and drinking; but poor
people might send to him from their sick bed, times and times
before he would come to them.&nbsp; Seeing so much of his
inconsistencies and shocking filthiness in their rooms, (though
they always paid the rent,) we were determined to give them
warning to quit our house, and we do think that a worse man or
woman ever came into any man&rsquo;s house before; especially as
Mr. Church pretended to preach the gospel; such hypocrites are
much worse than others, and besides this, we never heard any man
tell lies <a name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a> so fast in all our lives.&nbsp; It is a
great grief to us, that ever we went to hear him preach, or
suffered him to stop so long in our house.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;GEORGE <span
class="GutSmall">AND</span> FRANCES GEE.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>I now
proceed to relate and comment upon some remarkable circumstances
that have occurred since my last publication.&nbsp; During the
greater part of Sunday, my office was beset by <i>gangs</i> of
fellows who came in successively and threatened prosecutions for
what appeared in the paper about Church.&nbsp; In the morning a
constable named <i>Holmes</i> (hired no doubt for the purpose)
was employed with a ladder, in tearing down the bills that had
been posted up, announcing the publication of that morning
respecting Mr. Church.&nbsp; About noon, a man of the name of
<i>Shawe</i>, who, I understand is a sort of an attorney,
residing in St. George&rsquo;s fields, and who, it appears has
also been employed by Church, was standing in the midst of some
persons outside the door of the chapel, with the newspaper in his
hand, and was commenting on the <i>infamous</i> libels, as he
called them, that were published against that <i>most virtuous
character</i>, Mr. Church.&nbsp; He seemed as if he wanted to
provoke somebody to speak: and he soon had his wish; for a
Gentleman of the name of Webster, with whom I am well acquainted,
and whom I know to be as peaceable and correct a young man as any
in the world, came up, and feeling indignant at the recollection
of <i>certain transactions</i> which I shall state presently,
declared that every thing stated in that paper (<i>The Weekly
Dispatch</i>) was true.&nbsp; This was the <i>tremendous</i> riot
which this most <i>dangerous</i> gentleman committed.&nbsp; The
<i>peace-restoring</i> Mr. Shawe went immediately for a
<i>peace-officer</i>&mdash;the same fellow of the name of Holmes
who for three hours before had mobs of people collected around
him while he was tearing down my bills, gave charge of Mr.
Webster as a breaker of the peace, had him dragged like a felon
to the watch-house, and afterwards conveyed him to a filthy
lock-up-house in the Borough, where he was kept in a state of
imprisonment, from his comfortable house and family all that day
and night, until 12 o&rsquo;clock on Monday, when he was brought
before the magistrates at Union Hall.&nbsp; Of the proceedings
that then took place, the following account appeared in the
Morning Chronicle of Tuesday:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Riots at the
Obelisk</span>.&mdash;Tuesday, a Mr. Webster, <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>who is
employed in the house of Messrs. Evans and Co. eminent
hop-merchants in the Borough, was charged by a person of the name
of Shaw, with committing a riot and breach of the peace, on
Sunday morning, at the Obelisk, in St. George&rsquo;s-fields,
near the entrance of a chapel belonging to a preacher, named John
Church.&nbsp; The Magistrates said, that as Mr. Birnie, who had,
on a former day, heard another case similar to this, was absent,
they wished the case might be deferred until next day, and
desired Mr. Webster to attend accordingly.&nbsp; The prosecutor
observed, that it would be dangerous to allow Mr. Webster to be
at large, and desired that he might either be kept in custody or
held to bail.&nbsp; The Magistrate asked if there was any person
present ready to be bail for his appearance.&nbsp; Mr. Robert
Bell, the Editor of the <span class="smcap">Weekly
Dispatch</span>, who accompanied Mr. Webster as his friend, a
housekeeper in Lambeth, said he was ready to bail him.&nbsp; The
prosecutor then said, he had also a very serious complaint to
make against Mr. Bell, for the article which he published in his
last Sunday&rsquo;s newspaper, respecting Church, and he had one
of the papers in his hand.&nbsp; Mr. Bell told the Magistrates
that he was ready to meet any complaint of this kind; that he
conceived it to be his duty as one of the guardians of public
liberty, and public morals, to send forth the statement in
question; that he could prove the truth of every thing he had
written and published.&nbsp; The worthy Magistrate then asked Mr.
Webster if he would promise on his honour to attend next day,
which Mr. Webster assured him he would do, and he retired.&nbsp;
It is necessary to mention that Mr. Webster had been in a state
of imprisonment during the greater part of Sunday, and all Sunday
night.&mdash;<i>Morning Chronicle</i>, <i>April</i> 20, 1813.</p>
<p>This report is very correct, so far as it goes; but the
reporter might have added, that I told the Magistrates I had a
volume of documents in my possession to prove Church to be a most
infamous culprit, and that it was a disgrace to the moral
character of the nation, to suffer such a man to be a minister of
the Gospel.&nbsp; I have now a short comment to make on this
occasion.&nbsp; I am still at a loss <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>to know what complaint it was that
Shawe intended to prefer against me.&nbsp; I had committed no
riot, nor did I ever mix in any crowd, (in fact there was no
crowd or noise, except what the associates of Church had
created).&nbsp; Did he mean to complain to the Magistrates of the
publication in my paper?&nbsp; If so, he must be grossly ignorant
of law, not to know, that the magistrates for the county of
Surrey could take no cognizance of that which I published in the
city of London.&nbsp; And if they had, did he imagine that I
would enter into any such recognizance as Mr. Theodore Page, the
printer, in Blackfriars road, was obliged to do?&nbsp; No, Sir;
so long as I continue to live in a free country, I will suffer no
Justice of peace to lay an <i>illegal imprimatur</i> on my
press.&nbsp; Mr. Page, as quiet and discreet a man as ever
existed, who was not seen in any crowd, and who would be the
first to get away from any place where there happened to be the
slightest disturbance, is now bound in the penalty of 100l. to
preserve the peace! and for what, because he printed some
hand-bills, giving an account of Church&rsquo;s infamous
practices.&nbsp; And now, reader, mark again the conduct of this
<i>immaculate</i> preacher.&nbsp; He adopts no course of
proceeding, by which he may be enabled to falsify the accusations
made against him.&nbsp; No,&mdash;he wants to crush and smother
everything by violence; and still continue to levy contributions
on some poor fools who go to hear him; or, perhaps, occasionally
to convert his conventicle into an <i>accommodating shop</i> for
the <i>use</i> of others.</p>
<p>On Tuesday last Mr. Webster again appeared at Union Hall,
accompanied by his father, his brother, and some friends.&nbsp;
In support of the charge of riot, an old man and an old woman, of
the meanest appearance, declared, that Mr. Webster expressed a
wish to set the chapel on fire; but their evidence was not
believed, and they were turned out of the office.&nbsp; Goff, the
officer, had seen no act of riot.&nbsp; Mr. Webster being called
on for his statement, said, he had not uttered a word that could
provoke any disturbance.&nbsp; When he made the reply to
Shawe&rsquo;s comments on the Newspapers, he did assert, that he
could prove Church to be the character therein described, <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>because,
about ten or eleven year, ago he had been guilty of most
abominable conduct toward, his (Webster&rsquo;s) brother, then a
lad of 16.&nbsp; The moment the Magistrates heard this, they
appeared struck with amazement.&nbsp; They stopt all proceedings
against Mr. Webster, and desired his brother to be brought
forward.&nbsp; The office was cleared of all persons, except the
parties immediately concerned; the brother&rsquo;s deposition was
then taken, and a warrant was issued for Church to appear there
the next day.</p>
<p>On Wednesday J. Church appeared in consequence of the warrant
issued the day before for his apprehension on a charge of
abominable practices, attended by a number of his deluded
followers.&nbsp; Mr. W. Webster having deposed as to his attempts
on him, Church was ordered to find bail for his appearance at the
next Middlesex Sessions and Mr. Webster bound over to
prosecute.&nbsp; The magistrate observed that from the length of
time which had elapsed since the offence had been committed, he
thought a jury would not feel justified in finding him
guilty.&nbsp; Mr. Johnston, a young Gentleman of the law, who
attended for Mr. Webster, replied, that it was not the time for
them to discuss what was likely to be the verdict of a jury; that
he had recommended Mr. Webster to prefer an indictment against
Church, and Mr. W. had come to that resolution; and that whatever
might be the result of the trial, the evidence relating to the
conduct of Church would be of that disgusting nature as to stamp
his name with eternal infamy and disgrace.&nbsp; Church&rsquo;s
attorney observed that it was a conspiracy amongst another sect
to ruin Mr. Church&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; This Mr. Johnston
denied, and said that it was only a desire to bring him to
merited punishment.&nbsp; Mr. Johnston also said that if Mr.
Church acted like a man of prudence, and consulted his own
interest, he would desist from preaching until the indictment had
been tried, as it would be the means of preventing a breach of
the peace, but this he declined; and Shawe his attorney said they
should follow their own advice.&nbsp; Mr. Johnston informed
Church&rsquo;s attorney that it was Mr. Webster&rsquo;s intention
to indict, or bring an action against him for assault and false
imprisonment.</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>On that
very evening (incredible as it may appear) this very man, held to
bail for trial on the most horrid charges given on oath, had the
impudence to go into his chapel and preach to a crowded
audience.&nbsp; But his is a very <i>convenient
conscience-healing</i> system of faith, <a
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a> and perhaps his followers do not like
him the worse for his system of <i>practical morality</i>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<h3><i>Extract from the Weekly Dispatch of May</i> 2, 1813.</h3>
<p>The statements published in the two last numbers of the
Dispatch respecting this person have excited a degree of public
attention unexampled in the history of newspapers.&nbsp; I am
rejoiced at the circumstance; because it <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>serves to
shew how large a mass of virtuous feeling prevails among the
people of England, and how much alive they are to any
transactions that appear to violate the morals, or profane the
religion of their country.&nbsp; It is impossible for any one who
knows me, or is acquainted with my character, to suppose, that I
could have felt any thing like personal hostility against this
man.&nbsp; My sole motive for sending forth these publications,
has been to defend and preserve the public morals.&nbsp; In doing
so, I have disregarded all risks, and set all threats at
defiance.&nbsp; The reader may naturally ask whether I have not
said enough on this subject already.&nbsp; I thought so this day
week.&nbsp; Since last Sunday&rsquo;s publication, however, a
volume of new matter, respecting this prophaner of religion and
violator of morality has been communicated to me.</p>
<p>Among the recent communications that have been made to me in
the course of the week, the following are the more remarkable,
and ought to be proclaimed through all parts of the
kingdom.&nbsp; Several persons have been at a loss to know by
what authority this man presumed to take upon himself the
functions of a minister of the gospel.&nbsp; They have asked how
could a man so profligate&mdash;so notoriously criminal, come
forth to instruct others in religion.&nbsp; The question was
natural, and I will answer it.&nbsp; The practice among
Dissenters is, that when any man feels a strong desire to become
a preacher, he communicates the same to several Ministers, who
make strict enquiry into his qualifications as to piety,
learning, morals, &amp;c. and if they find these established on
satisfactory evidence, they confer on the candidate a sort of
ordination, without which he can have no authority to officiate
as a minster of the gospel.&nbsp; I understand that Church did
receive some ordination of this kind at the town of Banbury, in
Oxfordshire; from which place, as I stated in a former number, he
was driven away for his mal-practices.&nbsp; Since then he has
not been under the control, and has acted in defiance of all the
ordinances of the Dissenting Church.&nbsp; He has in fact gone
about as a mere isolated adventurer; and I am informed that no
minister will preach in any pulpit belonging to him.&nbsp; Yet he
continues to preach, in defiance <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>of Christian, as well as of moral
ordinances; because he cannot be silenced by any legal authority,
and because he rejects all ecclesiastical government.&nbsp; This
is the reason why I labour to rescue religion from the disgrace
which he throws upon it.&nbsp; And I again ask if it is to be
tolerated in a Christian, in a moral country, that a man ordered
by the magistrates to be tried for the basest of all crimes,
alleged against him on oath, should be suffered to collect an
assembly of English subjects around him under pretence of giving
them religious instruction?&nbsp; Is the government to suffer its
subjects to be thus contaminated?&nbsp; The magistrates of Sparta
and of Rome (which were heathen nations) would have permitted no
such sacrilege as this.</p>
<p>One character peculiar to the person I am speaking of is, that
wherever he has been admitted as a preacher, he has disturbed the
religious system, and upset the order of the place.&nbsp; No
later than Wednesday last, a gentleman from Colchester called at
my office, and told me that he has done so in that town; that he
turned the whole congregation against their minister, by
preaching doctrines tending to encourage licentiousness, and
foster the worst passions.&nbsp; All persons acquainted with
history will recollect, that this mode of healing the consciences
of profligate men was practised by the Romish Church before the
reformation, and when it flourished in its rankest state of
corruption&mdash;when indulgences for sins to be committed, and
pardon for sins past, were openly sold for money.&nbsp; The
manner in which the Obelisk Preacher conducts the affairs of his
chapel bears some resemblance to this practice.&nbsp; In other
places of worship, the practice is, for persons, who have been
appointed as trustees, to take charge of all the money collected
once a mouth, and after allowing a reasonable remuneration to the
minister, apply the remainder to the relief of the poor, and to
the repairs of the place.&nbsp; Hitherto, however, Mr. C&mdash;
has been in the habit of putting into his own pocket all the
money which he has raised by inflaming the passions and exciting
hopes and fears.&nbsp; I am informed that for the purpose of
encreasing his revenue, he has even administered the sacrament to
persons who were nearly introxicated <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>with gin!!&nbsp; At present my pen is
unable to proceed any further on this most disgusting
subject.</p>

<h3><i>Extract from the Dispatch of May</i> 9, 1813.</h3>
<p>The promise made in last Sunday&rsquo;s Dispatch, that a
description should every week be given of some conventicle
preacher noted for ignorance and absurdity, was at the time
rather premature, and the fulfilment of it must be suspended for
two or three weeks longer; because I wish to mark out a boundary
of separation, like an impassable chasm, between the character I
have hitherto been developing, and those I intend hereafter to
criticise.&nbsp; However great may be the mass of folly,
ignorance, and fanaticism, which prevail throughout most of the
low conventicles of this metropolis, and however injuriously they
may operate on the human mind, their effects are innocence and
virtue, compared to the influence of that guilt which I have
exposed, and which I am prepared to expose still more effectually
in any Court of Justice.&nbsp; I believe that the poor silly
visionaries who deal in pictures, in miracles, and monstrous
conceits, are not wilfully or practically vicious, and that they
have <i>lashed</i> themselves into a belief, of what they preach;
therefore I cannot think of dragging them forward so close upon
the heels of Mr. John Church, as to hold out an appearance of
their belonging to the same society.&nbsp; Some interval of time,
therefore, is necessary for the distinction which I wish to
draw.&nbsp; When I come to speak of them it shall be in a spirit
of playfulness, and not with a feeling of abhorrence.&nbsp;
Respecting the last mentioned person I should have been silent
ever since the 18th ultimo, had he preserved that <i>silence</i>
which a sense of common decency would have pointed out to any
other person, except himself.&nbsp; After having been held to
bail for the purpose of being tried on charges not to be named
among Christians, he ought to have abstained <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>from entering
his pulpit, and shunned the very light, until his character was
cleared to the satisfaction of his congregation, who ought to
have deemed it a sacrilege to be present while he attempted to
promulgate the doctrines of Christ in a place of divine
worship.&nbsp; But one would think there was a congeniality of
sentiment and of <i>sympathy</i> between the pastor and the
flock!&nbsp; Indeed this latter remark is founded upon something
more than conjecture: for a great number of persons who are in
the habit of frequenting the obelisk chapel, have taken up the
cause of their preacher with a zeal that cannot easily be
accounted for in any way but <i>one</i>.&nbsp; They will
investigate no charge; they reject all evidence.&nbsp; Their
<i>Temple</i> is open, and their <i>High Priest</i> is in as much
<i>favour</i> as ever he was.&nbsp; They are, I am told, raising
money to carry on prosecutions against those whom they call his
calumniators; but it is probable that the money will be expended
in <i>some other place</i>, besides Westminster Hall.&nbsp; I
have been threatened with an action as will appear by the
following notice, which was left at my office last Friday
se&rsquo;nnight, and which for the amusement of the reader I
publish <i>verbatim</i> and <i>literatim</i>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This precious composition (no attorney could write any thing
like it) bears the real signature of John Church which exactly
resembles that of the letter he wrote to Cook of
Vere-street.&nbsp; I now then call on him to put his threat into
execution; I call on him to bring his action against me; and he
may depend on it, I shall be prepared with my <i>proofs</i> and
my <span class="GutSmall">JUSTIFICATION</span>.&nbsp; I repeat
what I said in my last, that I bear this man no resentment of a
personal nature, I can have none towards one I never spoke to,
and never saw but once, and then in his pulpit.&nbsp; My sole
object is to do that which the civil power seems unable to
do&mdash;to prevent one of the most horrid of vices, from being
propagated through the medium of pretended sanctity.&nbsp; The
person of whom I am speaking, has called at my office, and
expressed a wish to see me (<i>this was very like bringing an
action</i>!) fortunately I was not there at the time; and I now
desire that neither he nor any of his associates may call on me,
for I will speak with none of them except in a Court of Law.</p>

<p>The following is the narrative which Cook has given to his
acquaintance with <i>Parson Church</i>; and which was taken down
from his own dictation by Mr. E&mdash; B&mdash;:</p>
<blockquote><p>In May, 1810, J. Cook was in company with Mr.
Yardley and another young man by the name of Ponder.&nbsp; I
found after <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>that the said Ponder was a drummer in the Guards; but
Cook went to call at a house in the London Road, where I saw Mr.
Church the first time in my life; there was at this house about
twelve or fourteen altogether drinking gin, and Mr. Church handed
me a glass of the same, which I took; Church behaved very polite
to me, and said what a fine fellow I was, he pressed me very much
to stop and get tea with them, for he said he would call and see
me when I was settled in the house in Vere-street.&nbsp; I
stopped a little while and was about to leave them when Church
said I should not go before I had tea, and flung down a dollar,
and a man by the name of Gaiscoin took the money and went for the
tea and other things but I would not stay, Church came out of the
room with me, and walked with me as far as the turnpike, there he
met another Gentleman which I never saw before, and I went on and
left him for that time, I think it was 6 or 8 days.&nbsp; I went
to live at the Swan, and saw Church again, he came about 3
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and Mr. Yardley accosted him,
&lsquo;Parson what are you come to see the Chappel?&rsquo; he
said &lsquo;yes, and to preach too:&rsquo; Church asked me how I
was, I said I was not very well, he asked me why I went away in
that shy manner, I told him he was a stranger to me, and I did
not like to be intruding on strange people, he said I was shy, he
did not know what to make of me, he also pressed me very much to
take a walk with him, but I declined it, he said I must go, but I
still declined, and did not go with him, he staid some time and
joined the company that was in the Back Parlour, persons by the
name of Miss Fox and Miss Kitty Cambrick was among them, and the
Queen of Bohemia.&nbsp; As Mr. C. was going away, he came to the
bar and spoke to me, and said I must take something to drink,
which I did, and he paid for it, and left the house for that
time.&nbsp; In a few days he called again in the afternoon, and
there was not many people there, he asked if Yardly was at home,
I said he was not, he said he was very sorry for it, I asked him
what he wanted, he said he came on purpose for me to take a walk
with him, but I did not go, he said he would wait until Yardly
came in, Church said I should do him a great favor if I would
take a walk with him, I would not go, he still pressed me very
much to go, I said I would if he would wait till I had cleaned
myself, he waited more than two hours for me, I went to steep
because I would not go with him, and in the mean time he waited
so long that he was tired, he sent the waiter to call me, which
he did, and said the Parson wanted me, and had been waiting two
<a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>hours for
me, I said him wait, for I should not come, he returned and said
if I would but speak to him, he should go away happy.&nbsp; I
found I could not get rid of him, I went down stairs, he said
well, Sir, I hope your nap has done you good, I said I dont know,
dont bother me, he said I was very cross to him, I told him there
was other men without me, if he wanted to preach, not to preach
to me about crossness.&nbsp; He said well if that was the case he
was very sorry he had offended me, I told him he had not offended
me nor pleased me, but as I was not well and the less any one
talked to me the better I liked it.&nbsp; He said if I was but
friends with him, and shake hands with him, he should go away
happy.&nbsp; Mr. Yardly said, I never see such a fellow as I was,
for I had affronted every body that came to the house.&nbsp; I
then shook hands with the Parson, for at that time I did not know
his name.&nbsp; He shook hands with me, and we had something to
drink, and Mr. Church paid for it and went away.&nbsp; I never
saw him until I came out of Newgate, I was talking to Mr. and
Mrs. Holloway, and telling them there was a Parson somewhere
about St. George&rsquo;s Fields, but his name I did not
know.&nbsp; He asked me if I should know him if I saw him, I said
I should, by that I went to the Chapel and saw Mr. Church, and
then I asked the people what was the Parson&rsquo;s name, they
told me his name was Church.&nbsp; I said he ought to be ashamed
of himself to preach there, a *** and rascal, and left the place,
and went home in the greatest pains I ever felt in my life, and
was resolved to see him, which I did the next day, and give him
one of the hand-bills, and the manner he received me, was like a
young man would his sweetheart, I begun my
conversation:&mdash;Well, Sir, I suppose you do not know
me.&nbsp; He said he did not.&nbsp; I said my name was Cook, that
kept the Swan, in Vere street.&nbsp; He said he thought so, but
was not sure: he said, why did I not call before and shake hands
with a body.&nbsp; I told him I did not know where he lived, nor
I did not know his name until I went to the Chapel and found him
out.&nbsp; He told me not to make it known that he ever came to
my house, for he and Roland Hill had daggers drawn, and that he
should be obliged to indite Hill to clear up his character, and
for God&rsquo;s sake do not expose me.</p>

37</span>POSTCRIPT.</h2>
<p>In addition to the above testimonies, the Editor has received
a very long narrative of atrocities committed by <span
class="smcap">John Church</span> while he resided at Banbury,
which has been written by a Minister at that place; but the facts
are too disgusting and shocking to be published.</p>
<p>On the 6th of June 1813, the Grand Jury for the County of
Middlesex found a Bill of Indictment against <i>John Church</i>
for his attempt some years ago on a lad named Webster.</p>

POSTCRIPT.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>July</i> 15.</p>
<p>This Pamphlet was printed and ready for publication some weeks
since; but the Editor thought proper to keep it back until the
trial of John Church, which came on at the Middlesex Sessions on
Monday the 12th of July 1813; when he was <i>acquitted</i>.&nbsp;
Indeed the Editor never imagined that any other verdict than one
of acquittal, would have been given on that particular
prosecution.&nbsp; If the Reader looks back to pages <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page25">25</a></span> and <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page26">26</a></span>, he will find
in the account there given of the proceedings at Union Hall, that
this prosecution was <span class="GutSmall">ORDERED</span> by the
Magistrates of that Office, and <i>did not originate</i> with the
prosecutor, William Webster, on whom the abominable attempt was
alleged to have been made eleven years ago; that the very mention
of the attempt was a mere incidental circumstance arising out of
another proceeding then before the Magistrates; and that the
latter, upon hearing it, dismissed the first complaint, and
obliged Wm. Webster to become (what he never until then intended
to be) a prosecutor against Church.&nbsp; Let the Reader also
take notice of the following sentence in the report in page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page26">26</a></span>: &ldquo;The
Magistrate observed, that from the length of time which had
elapsed since the offence had been committed, he thought a Jury
would not feel justified in finding him guilty.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
William Webster, therefore, considered, in all respects, as an
unwilling prosecutor, who was supported only by one counsel of
young standing, <a name="citation38a"></a><a href="#footnote38a"
class="citation">[38a]</a> and had to struggle against two of the
most able advocates <a name="citation38b"></a><a
href="#footnote38b" class="citation">[38b]</a> in the criminal
courts.&nbsp; The Editor (for he was not present at the trial)
understands that Webster gave his evidence with embarrassment and
trepidation, and he suffered himself to fall into some
inconsistencies.&nbsp; With this <i>solitary</i> and confused
evidence, and after a lapse&mdash;after a <i>silence</i> of <span
class="GutSmall">ELEVEN YEARS</span>, was it possible to suppose
that a Jury would have found any man guilty?&nbsp; It must here
be observed that the decision on this solitary complaint of
eleven years standing, does not in the slightest degree affect
any of the numerous accusation at a more recent date, which have
been made against John Church.</p>
<h2>FOOTNOTES.</h2>
<p><a name="footnote5"></a><a href="#citation5"
class="footnote">[5]</a>&nbsp; In the <span
class="smcap">Dispatch</span> of the 21st ult. the Editor, when
speaking of the publicity given to the evidence respecting the
Princess of Wales, expressed the following sentiments on this
question: &ldquo;There are cases in which a great deal more
injury both to morals and liberty, may arise from the suppression
than the exposure of indecencies.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Complaints
have often been made from very high quarters of the publicity
given to certain proceedings in Courts of Justice; and it is but
justice to say, that within the last twenty years, the press has
been very cautious in its manner of relating them.&nbsp; But it
is a matter of doubt with many wise men whether the suppression
of facts in such instances does not, upon the whole, do more
injury to public morals than a complete disclosure of them;
particularly so, if there be any suspicion that facts have been
suppressed.&rdquo;</p>

class="footnote">[11]</a>&nbsp; A Correspondent, who happened to
attend two or three times at Church&rsquo;s Meeting-house, took
down the following sentences from his Sermons.&nbsp; They may
gratify the curiosity of the reader.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;God is frequently going forth, and we also
are often going to the window to look for him; The more <i>vile I
am</i> made to appear to the <i>World</i> the more <i>God</i>
will <i>assist</i> me.&nbsp; Every citizen is a free-born.&nbsp;
Many have wondered how I could go thro&rsquo; so much
trouble.&nbsp; There have been a great many that have wished to
see me&mdash;I can inform them I had much rather they had wished
to see Christ.&nbsp; People may be laughed at for being fools,
but you may depend upon it the more God will like them.&nbsp; All
that believe not will certainly be damned.&nbsp; The duties of
Christianity are not to be preached to an ungodly world; John
Church is very much spoken of, but they had much better speak of
Jesus; the people of the established church feel no spiritual
joy.&nbsp; Spiritual discourse is enlivening to the senses,
&amp;c.&nbsp; The bread of life is not to be given away to
<i>Dogs</i>.&nbsp; I am not going to turn auctioneer, but I am
going to inform you that next Lord&rsquo;s Day I am going to
publish a book proving that God the Son, and the Spirit, are all
one great God.&nbsp; My sermon will be good news and comfort to
all poor sinners; Satan and all his spirits never sleeps; the
power of life and death is only in the hands of our Lord Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; Devils are allowed to harrass the people of God day
and night&mdash;no wonder they perplex those they cant
destroy.&nbsp; People are mostly liable to fall in their first
love into awful heresies and temptation.&nbsp; All the
Lord&rsquo;s people do not see into the glory of my
text&mdash;&rsquo;tis like a jewel in a rock of Adamant.&nbsp;
The worst sin was the murdering of God&rsquo;s saints.&nbsp; When
I sit in darkness the Lord will be a light unto me.&nbsp; Many
men laugh at the doctrine of the new birth,&mdash;are there not
many learned Doctors that know nothing of it?&nbsp; Let a man
come under any circumstances I will receive
him;&mdash;Don&rsquo;t laugh at the doctrine of inspiration; he
wise, it has often been preached by our church,&mdash;I am never
tired of preaching, and I believe my dear brethren are never
tired of hearing me.&nbsp; If every one that is saved should be
as bright as the sun, what a place heaven must be, where there
will be so many millions!&nbsp; Angels beckon me away, and Christ
bids me come.&nbsp; The sight of Christ, you may depend
on&rsquo;t, will be worth suffering for.&nbsp; O that I had the
voice of an archangel, I would indeed do wonders.&nbsp; I doubt
the superiority of one angel over another in heaven&mdash;Christ
is entirely independent, of or with God.&nbsp; We must have the
spirit of God before we are his people.&nbsp; Believe in the
predestination of eternal life, but not in eternal death; people
that suffer were beforehand predestined so to do, <i>by
God</i>.&nbsp; Bad or horrid is the religion of a proud
Pharisee.&nbsp; That religion that is preached by the people of
God is God himself.&nbsp; There can be no going forth until the
Spirit of God has entered.&nbsp; The <span
class="GutSmall">MOB</span> is seldom stirred up but thro&rsquo;
Priests, there is now a case of the very kind; when envy bursts
forth thro&rsquo; jealous and envious neighbouring
<i>Priests</i>, and published by <i>Deists</i>, there can be
nothing to fear; and I verily believe that any thing prayed for
to Christ will certainly be granted, as has always been the case
with me.&nbsp; Let us for ever endeavour to turn every thing,
whether good or bad, into good.&nbsp; I do not not believe that
God begot Jesus Christ&mdash;they say too that Joseph was an
impostor at this very day;&mdash;every thing that is done against
the church is done against Christ; also that which is done
against Christ is done against the Church; and any thing done
against the people of God is done against Christ.&nbsp; It is a
most blessed thing that we can throw our burthens upon
Christ;&mdash;I do not care who hears me, whether <i>God</i>, or
<i>Man</i>, <i>Friends</i>, or <i>Foes</i>, <i>Devils</i> or
<i>Angels</i>, or any thing else, and let them call me an
Antinomian again if they please.&nbsp; There must be spiritual
life in the soul.&nbsp; The Lord Jesus Christ and the people of
God are all one.&nbsp; Christ has no sorrow but the people of God
must sympathise with him; and the people of God have no
affliction but that Christ sympathises with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="footnote20"></a><a href="#citation20"
class="footnote">[20]</a>&nbsp; Alluding to his being turned out
of Banbury.</p>
<p><a name="footnote21"></a><a href="#citation21"
class="footnote">[21]</a>&nbsp; Before Church got to bed to young
Clark, he scoffed at secret prayer.&nbsp; What abominable
hypocrisy, to hear the same man pretending to pray before a
public congregation, where he can get himself paid for his
devotions! how he must hate and despise himself on account of his
own most odious cant!!!</p>
<p><a name="footnote22"></a><a href="#citation22"
class="footnote">[22]</a>&nbsp; A full proof of this has been
given, in the falsehoods he has repeatedly urged, to ward off the
charges brought against him in these papers.</p>
<p><a name="footnote27"></a><a href="#citation27"
class="footnote">[27]</a>&nbsp; I am informed that Church belongs
to that sect called <span class="smcap">Antinomians</span>, which
is thus described by the Rev. John Evans in his &ldquo;Sketch of
the Denominations of the Christian World&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Antinomian derives his name from <span
class="smcap">Anti</span> and <span class="smcap">Nomos</span>;
signifying, against, and a Law, his favourite tenet being, that
the law is not a rule of life to believers.&nbsp; It is not easy
to ascertain what he means by this position, but he seems to
carry the doctrine of imputed righteousness of Christ and
salvation by faith without works to such lengths as to injure, if
not wholly destroy the obligation to moral obedience.&nbsp;
Antinomianism may be traced to the period of the reformation, and
its promulgator was John Agricola, originally a disciple of
Luther.&nbsp; The Papists in their disputes with the Protestants
of that day, carried the merit of good works to an extravagant
length; and this induced some of their opponents to run into the
opposite extreme.&nbsp; &ldquo;This sect (say the Encyclopedia)
sprung up in England during the protectorate of Oliver Cromwell,
and extended the system of libertinism much farther than
Agricola, the disciple of Luther.&nbsp; Some of their teachers
expressly maintained, that as the elect cannot fall from grace
nor forfeit the divine favour, the wicked actions they commit are
not really sinful, nor are they to be considered as instances of
their violation of the Divine Law; consequently they have no
occasion to confess their sins, or to break them off by
repentance.&nbsp; According to them it is one of the essential
and distinctive characters of the elect that they cannot do any

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
